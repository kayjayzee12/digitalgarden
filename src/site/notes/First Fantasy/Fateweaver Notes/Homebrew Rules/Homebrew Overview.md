### **Overview: Homebrew ICRPG Rules**

#### **[[First Fantasy/Fateweaver Notes/Homebrew Rules/Hero Coins\|Hero Coins]]**

Hero Coins represent moments of extraordinary bravery, cunning, or brilliance. Players can earn Hero Coins for exceptional roleplay, clever ideas, or extraordinary teamwork. These coins can be spent to:

- Reroll a single dice roll.
- Grant an ally advantage on a roll.
- Immediately recover 1D6 HP in a pinch.

Encourage their use to drive dynamic moments that the table will remember. 

---

#### **Player Actions**

Each turn in ICRPG grants players **two action** and **one move**. Actions are versatile and can include:

- Attacks
- Spells
- Searching
- Tactical movement (e.g., vaulting over an obstacle)

Add **"Stunts"** as a homebrew action type, where players can attempt cinematic maneuvers, such as sliding between an enemy's legs or somersaulting over hazards. These can require a **HARD Roll** but reward creativity with a small bonus or added effect.

---

#### **Dying and Death Saves**

When a character hits **0 HP**, they are considered **Dying** and must roll a **CON Save** each turn. Use the following table for outcomes:

- **12+**: Stable but unconscious.
- **6-11**: On the brink; roll again next turn.
- **5 or less**: Dead.

To heighten tension, dying characters can perform a single, desperate **FINAL ACT**, like throwing a potion to an ally or making one last attack. This exhausts them fully, leading to certain death.

---

#### **Dynamic Initiative**

To spice up encounters, use the **"Popcorn" Initiative** system:

1. The GM chooses the first player to act.
2. After their turn, that player picks who goes next (including enemies).
3. The last to act in a round picks who starts the next round.

This keeps initiative unpredictable and promotes tactical thinking.

---

#### **Timers**

Introduce **"Doom Timers"** for pressure-filled moments. For example:

- **"The bridge collapses in 3 turns!"**
- **"Reinforcements arrive in 2 rounds!"**

Players must balance problem-solving with urgency, increasing tension and engagement.

---

#### **Effort Tweaks**

Expand **Effort Types** with thematic tools:

- **Plague Effort**: For actions tied to disease, decay, or mutation, use D4.
- **Magitech Effort**: Reflecting advanced tools or constructs, use D8 or D10.

Custom effort dice add flavor and strengthen worldbuilding mechanics.

---

#### **Recovery and Rest**

Add a **short recovery roll** mid-combat: Players may spend an action to recover **1D6 + CON** HP. This rewards tactical choices during intense encounters and keeps players on their toes without waiting for long rests.

---

#### **Roleplaying Momentum**

Reward consistent, immersive roleplay by granting a **"Momentum Die" (D6)**. Players can add this to any roll in moments when their roleplaying deeply engages or advances the story meaningfully. This mechanic encourages immersion and rewards players for staying in character.

---

#### **Optional: Mutation Mechanics**

To fit a "plague and mutation" theme:

- When interacting with unstable magitech or plague zones, players may roll a **Mutation Table**.
- Results can range from small boons (e.g., darkvision) to drawbacks (e.g., uncontrollable tremors).

Mutations could be reversible or permanent depending on the arc's tone.

These homebrew rules aim to heighten excitement, immersion, and the "anything can happen" vibe of ICRPG while providing thematic tweaks that fit into your high-fantasy magitech world.
