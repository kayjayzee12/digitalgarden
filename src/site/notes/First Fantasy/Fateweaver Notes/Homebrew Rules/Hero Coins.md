# Expanded Hero Coins Rules

Hero Coins aren’t just personal boons—they're a **shared narrative currency** between players and the GM. Players can **earn, trade, spend, and even gamble** with them to shape the game in new ways.

---

## 🏅 Earning Hero Coins

Players can earn Hero Coins for:

- **Cinematic Roleplay**: Making the table cheer with a dramatic speech, witty comeback, or emotional moment.
- **Epic Stunts**: Pulling off high-risk, high-reward maneuvers.
- **Teamwork**: Saving an ally, sacrificing an action to help, or setting up a cool combo.
- **Meta Moves**: Accepting a major setback for the sake of drama (e.g., choosing to fail a roll in an interesting way).
- **Bargaining with the GM**: Players can *offer* to take on extra challenges, conditions, or **GM complications** in exchange for Hero Coins.

## 🎟️ Spending Hero Coins (Expanded Uses)

### **Basic Uses (1 Coin)**
- **Reroll Any Attempt.**

- **Turn a HARD Roll into a NORMAL Roll.**
- **Pull a "Flashback" Move:** Introduce a useful item or a clever preparation from before.

### **Advanced Uses (2 Coins)**

- **Trade for a Favor from the GM (Negotiable).** 

### **Epic Uses (3 Coins)**

- **Call in a Backup NPC:** "My contact owes me a favor."
- **Survive the Impossible:** Avoid what *should* be instant death (GM decides cost/consequences).

## 🔄 Trading Hero Coins Between Players

Players can **trade Hero Coins** among themselves at any time, with a few rules:

- **Bartering Encouraged:** Players can demand "favors" in exchange for their Coins (roleplay encouraged!).
- **Co-op Powers:** If **two players pool their Coins**, they can:
  - **Guarantee a Critical Hit** (turn any successful roll into a **Nat 20**).
  - **Fuse Spells/Abilities** into one "combo move" (GM decides how).
  - **Undo a Major Mistake** (GM’s discretion).

## 🏦 Trading Hero Coins with the GM

Players can **offer** Hero Coins to the GM in exchange for certain **story benefits or meta-game deals.** The GM may set the price or **counteroffer**.

### **Suggested GM Trades**
| **Hero Coin Cost** | **What the Player Gets** |
|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 Coin | The GM hints at **a hidden clue** or detail. |
| 2 Coins | The GM **reduces** an encounter's difficulty (e.g., fewer reinforcements). |
| 3 Coins | The GM allows the PC to **"find"** a needed item or resource. |
| 4 Coins | The GM allows the PC to **alter an enemy’s motivation or allegiance.** |
| 5+ Coins | The player influences **world-level events** (GM approval). |

> **📌 Note:** If the **GM ever spends Hero Coins**, those Coins **must** go back into the players' economy.

## 🎲 "Hero Coin Betting" Rule

At any time, a player can **bet Hero Coins** against the GM in a **"high-stakes roll-off"**:

1. **Both roll 1d20**.
2. If the player wins, they gain **double** the wagered Coins.
3. If the GM wins, the Coins are lost **and** the GM adds a **twist** to the story.

This makes for **high-risk, high-reward** moments and adds a gambling element.

---

## 🏛️ The "Hero Bank"

Players can choose to put Coins into a **shared pool** called the **Hero Bank**.

- Anyone can contribute.
- Any player can **draw from the pool**, but must **justify** their use.
- If the pool reaches **10+ Coins**, a **special group-wide effect triggers** (e.g., everyone gets a free action).

This encourages cooperation **without** hoarding.

---

## 🔥 Final Thoughts

By making **Hero Coins tradeable** between players and the GM, they evolve into a **meta-currency** that:

- Enhances **collaboration and negotiation**.
- Adds **risk, tension, and drama**.
- Gives players **agency over the story**.
