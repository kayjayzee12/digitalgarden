In Crystalpunk, souls and mana are central currencies. The abuse of souls for fueling magitech devices exemplifies the worldâ€™s moral decay and the commodification of the essence of life itself. This contrasts with First Fantasy, where spiritual elements like Limit Breaks reflect the personal and metaphysical power tied to individual lives.
