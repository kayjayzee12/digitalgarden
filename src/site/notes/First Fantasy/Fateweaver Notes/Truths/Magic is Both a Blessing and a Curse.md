#truth

Magic serves as the foundation of both societies, but its misuse can lead to disastrous consequences. In First Fantasy, magic shapes entire civilizations but comes with corruption and inherent risks, especially evident in classes like Dread Knights and the effects of magicks. Similarly, in Crystalpunk, magic fuels technology and progress but at a severe cost to resources, humanity, and the soul itself.
