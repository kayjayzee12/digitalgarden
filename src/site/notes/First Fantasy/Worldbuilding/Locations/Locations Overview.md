### **2. Locations**

#### **[[First Fantasy/Worldbuilding/Locations/The Falls/Prismatic Falls\|Prismatic Falls]]**

The sprawling megacity of Prismatic Falls is the crown jewel of Aysta, a place where the highest technological advancements and the deepest societal corruption coexist. Divided into starkly contrasting districts, the city is a microcosm of the world's larger conflicts.

- **Cloudtops:**  
    Perched above the pollution and chaos, the Cloudtops are the exclusive domain of the ultra-rich and corporate elite. Here, floating skyscrapers and shimmering arcane spires create a glittering utopia for those who can afford it. Magitech-powered hover trains connect the corporate headquarters, and artificial skies ensure perpetual sunlight.
    
    - **Notable Landmarks:**
        - **Elysian Tower:** Headquarters of the Crystal Communion, a corporate cult worshipping the gods of magitech.
        - **The Aurora Gardens:** A massive biodome filled with preserved nature from pre-magitech times, reserved for corporate executives.
- **Red Districts:**  
    The underbelly of Prismatic Falls, home to crime syndicates, rebel cells, and those who have fallen through society’s cracks. Neon signs light the damp, narrow streets, and every corner hums with the illicit trade of magitech, drugs, and stolen souls.
    
    - **Notable Landmarks:**
        - **The Crimson Exchange:** The largest black market for illegal magitech and soul crystals.
        - **The Rusted Siren:** A tavern and rebel safehouse disguised as a seedy dive bar.
- **Industrial Crust:**  
    The backbone of Prismatic Falls, this sector houses massive factories and research labs where the workforce toils endlessly to sustain the city’s magitech economy. The air is thick with smog, and the constant hum of machinery fills the streets.
    
    - **Notable Landmarks:**
        - **Soulforge Complex:** A massive facility where captured souls are extracted and infused into crystals.
        - **The Magitech Foundry:** Experimental magitech is tested here, often with catastrophic results.
- **Dead Zones:**  
    A forbidden region within Prismatic Falls, the Dead Zones are the remnants of failed magitech experiments. The air crackles with unstable energy, and reality itself seems to bend and twist here.
    
    - **Notable Landmarks:**
        - **The Rift Lab:** Abandoned after a catastrophic experiment, this lab now serves as a lair for rogue magitech constructs.
        - **Echo Spire:** A crystalline tower said to amplify nightmares into living entities.

#### **[[First Fantasy/Worldbuilding/Locations/The Jungles/The Overgrowth\|The Overgrowth]]**

A vast, ancient jungle where nature has merged with rampant magic, creating an ecosystem of mutated flora and fauna. The Overgrowth is as beautiful as it is deadly, with glowing plants, bioluminescent fungi, and massive, intelligent predators.

- **Notable Regions:**
    - **The Heartwood:** A massive, sentient tree rumored to hold secrets from before the magitech era.
    - **The Beastkin Enclaves:** Hidden villages of Beastfolk who use primal magics to survive and thrive in the jungle.

#### **[[First Fantasy/Worldbuilding/Locations/The sands/The Scorching Frontier\|The Scorching Frontier]]**

A desolate wasteland of cracked earth and blazing sun, the Scorching Frontier was once a fertile land before being ravaged by magitech overuse. Demons and rogue magitech constructs now roam freely, preying on travelers and settlers.

- **Notable Landmarks:**
    - **The Infernal Forge:** An ancient structure where demons are captured and their energy is used to power magitech vehicles.
    - **The Rust Barrens:** A vast expanse of derelict vehicles and machinery, picked clean by scavengers.

A fractured land of once-great kingdoms now reduced to squabbling factions. The countryside is dotted with crumbling castles, abandoned towns, and battlefields littered with broken magitech weaponry.

- **Notable Regions:**
    - **Aelthorne Keep:** The last stronghold of the Shattered Empire’s royal family, who cling to the hope of reunification.
    - **The Wailing Marshes:** A cursed swamp filled with restless spirits and magitech wreckage.
    - **The Blackened Fields:** A battlefield where magitech weapons burned the land, leaving it eternally scorched.

#### **[[The Forgotten Depths\|The Forgotten Depths]]**

Beneath Aysta’s surface lies a labyrinth of tunnels, ancient ruins, and underground cities. The Forgotten Depths were once the homes of early magitech pioneers, abandoned after experiments went awry.

- **Notable Features:**
    - **The Glowveil Vaults:** Ancient vaults filled with unstable magitech artifacts.
    - **The Crystal Caves:** A natural network of tunnels lined with mana crystals. It’s said the crystals here whisper secrets to those who listen.

#### **[[The Void Verge\|The Void Verge]]**

A mysterious region where the boundary between Aysta and the Void is thin. The laws of nature bend here, creating a surreal and dangerous landscape. Few return from the Void Verge unchanged—or at all.

- **Notable Landmarks:**
    - **The Ebon Maw:** A swirling vortex of Void energy that occasionally spills into Aysta.
    - **The Fractured Observatory:** An ancient tower where void-touched scholars once studied the stars and the Void.
