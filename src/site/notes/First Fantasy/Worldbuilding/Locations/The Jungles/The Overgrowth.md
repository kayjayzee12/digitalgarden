The Overgrowth, as detailed in the Crystalpunk Campaign Guide, is a fascinating and perilous location, full of anomalies, rich history, and vibrant ecosystems. Here's an expanded overview:

### Overview

The Overgrowth is an immense jungle that sprawls endlessly, characterized by its dense vegetation, magic-saturated atmosphere, and abundance of mysteries. It serves as the ancestral homeland of the Beastfolk and the site of many ancient ruins left behind by the mysterious Precursors​.

### Magical Properties

The Overgrowth's magic pervades its environment, with effects that influence both its flora and fauna:

- **Mana Amplification**: Spells cast by non-Beastfolk in the Overgrowth often surge in power, sometimes unexpectedly enhancing or altering their effects​.
- **Wild Magic Anomalies**: The jungle hosts magical phenomena such as invisible portals, thought fields that manifest imaginations, and pools with unpredictable effects​.
- **Empowered Wildlife**: Animals and plants in the Overgrowth are infused with mana, leading to increased size, intelligence, and aggression. These include treants, hags, and even dinosaurs​.

### Key Locations

### Tribes and Inhabitants

### Threats and Challenges

- **Mythical Beasts**: Dinosaurs, vine dragons, and mana-enhanced predators roam the forest, posing constant danger to both natives and explorers​.

### Cultural and Historical Context

The Overgrowth is deeply connected to Aysta's history, particularly through its association with the Precursors. The origins of the jungle are still debated, with hypotheses ranging from failed experiments in eternal growth to magical portals merging dimensions​.
