### Overview

The ruins range from small outposts to sprawling cities, with the most notable being the **Lost City**. These structures are made from materials imbued with mana, showcasing advanced architectural and arcane techniques. Despite their resilience, many ruins are now overgrown or partially collapsed due to the relentless expansion of the Overgrowth​.

### Features of the Ruins

1. **Runic Inscriptions**: The ruins are covered in mysterious runes written in an ancient script that has proven extremely difficult to decipher. Some of the language has been translated to enhance modern magitech, but much remains incomprehensible​.
2. **Magical Artifacts**: Powerful and often unpredictable artifacts are hidden within the ruins, ranging from enchanted weapons to strange devices​.
3. **Anomalous Sites**: Many ruins contain anomalies such as portals, energy fields, or reality-warping effects. These are believed to be remnants of the Lunarians' advanced magical experimentation.
