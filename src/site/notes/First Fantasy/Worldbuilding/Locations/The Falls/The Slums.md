### Expanded Guide to the Slums of Prismatic Falls

#### **Overview**

The Slums of Prismatic Falls form the city’s lowest and most dangerous layer. Located beneath the Streets, they consist of a sprawling network of tunnels and abandoned infrastructure. The Slums are home to the city’s most desperate residents, including the homeless, the unaffiliated, and those cast out by the cults. Life here is characterized by hopelessness, rampant crime, and frequent flooding, making it a place of both literal and metaphorical darkness​.

#### **Key Features**

1. **Living Conditions**
    
    - The Slums are an unregulated area, allowing for rampant poverty and lawlessness.
    - Residents rely on makeshift shanties and salvaged materials for shelter, with minimal access to light except for arcane crystals, glowworms, and the occasional light cantrip​.
2. **Monsters and Nightmares**
    
    - With no cult oversight, the Slums are a breeding ground for living nightmares and other monsters. These creatures thrive on the fear and despair prevalent in this area​.
3. **Infrastructure**
    
    - The drainage system is broken, leading to frequent flooding during heavy rains. This often results in the displacement of residents and the destruction of their fragile shelters​.

#### **Notable Areas**

1. **The Upper Levels**
    
    - These are the least dangerous parts of the Slums, populated by homeless residents. The area is littered with broken machinery and illuminated only by natural arcane phenomena​.
2. **Hag Dens**
    
    - Found in the upper levels, these dens are run by older individuals selling spliced narcotics, dubious magical items, and illegal weaponry. The infamous **Hag Mathilda**, unaffiliated with any cult, is surrounded by swarms of rats under her mysterious control​.
3. **The Slum Markets**
    
    - Located in the North District, this market is operated by the Minstrel Cult and serves as both a trading hub and a means to gather intelligence on the lower populace. Goods are of poor quality and are often traded rather than purchased​.
4. **Altars of the Wanderer**
    
    - Hidden altars to the Wanderer are maintained by the Slum’s residents. Many who visit these shrines either get lost in the labyrinthine tunnels or mysteriously disappear, with rumors of rebel involvement​.
5. **The Xorn Layer**
    
    - Deeper in the Slums, this area is inhabited by opportunistic Xorn, who steal from anyone they encounter. These creatures rarely venture beyond their layer, but their growing boldness poses a threat​.
6. **The Abyssal Pit**
    
    - Located beneath the Temple of Fiscal Perpetuity, the Abyssal Pit is a mysterious shaft extending far below the city. Its bottom remains unexplored, shrouded in myths and rumors​.
7. **The Smuggler’s Lane**
    
    - An underground railway in the South Sector run by the Kingmaker Cult, it is used to transport foreign and illegal goods into the city. It is rumored to connect with every major settlement in Aysta.

    - Intermittent flooding spreads disease and worsens living conditions, with few resources available for medical care or clean water​.
