## **City Overview**

  

Prismatic Falls is renowned for its towering skyscrapers and the perpetual rain that drenches all but its highest levels. The city’s structure and culture are shaped by its verticality and social stratification. Life in the city varies drastically depending on the height of one’s residence and their cult affiliation, with those above the clouds enjoying wealth and power, while those in the slums and mines struggle for survival .

  

### **Districts and Layers**

  

Prismatic Falls is divided both vertically (into five layers) and horizontally (into six sectors, each governed by a dominant cult). The five layers are:

1. [[First Fantasy/Worldbuilding/Locations/The Falls/The Cloudtops\|The Cloudtops]]: Reserved for the wealthy and influential, these skyscrapers rise above the perpetual rain. Skysiders, as they are called, enjoy exclusive privileges, but their lives are shaped by the political intrigues of the cults .

2. [[First Fantasy/Worldbuilding/Locations/The Falls/The High Rises\|The High Rises]]: The middle class resides here. This layer hosts cult infrastructure, manufacturing hubs, and the homes of less influential but still connected individuals .

3. [[First Fantasy/Worldbuilding/Locations/The Falls/The Streets\|The Streets]]: A bustling urban sprawl rife with markets, crime, and arcane firefights. This is where the average citizen survives amidst constant danger .

4. [[First Fantasy/Worldbuilding/Locations/The Falls/The Slums\|The Slums]]: A dire place of poverty and violence. Many of its residents work as scavengers or laborers, and it is frequently plagued by floods and disease .

5. [[First Fantasy/Worldbuilding/Locations/The Falls/The Mines\|The Mines]]: Underground, where resources such as crystals are extracted. It is the harshest and most dangerous layer, home to forced labor and rampant crime .
