### Expanded Guide to The High Rises of Prismatic Falls

#### **Overview**

The High Rises are the bustling heart of Prismatic Falls, located just below the Cloudtops. This layer is characterized by towering skyscrapers densely packed together, creating an urban jungle of glass, stone, and neon lights. The majority of the city’s population resides here, enjoying moderate comfort and modern conveniences. However, this stability is precarious, with many teetering on the edge of financial ruin​.

#### **Key Features**

1. **Urban Density**
    
    - Skyscrapers stand so close that neighbors can reach out and touch one another across the narrow divides. In contrast, some buildings are separated by wide chasms, navigable only by elevated bridges and train lines​.
    - Gray stone façades and glowing signs dominate the aesthetic, blending industrial practicality with flashes of arcane brilliance​.
2. **Population**
    
    - High-Risers are a mix of middle-class workers and cult affiliates. They often view themselves as superior to those in the Streets and Slums, using terms like "Wetlanders" and "Puddlestompers" to describe those below them.
3. **Access and Mobility**
    
    - Public transit, such as trains and Infernal Elevators, is widely available. However, many residents prefer to remain in their immediate area, as daily needs are easily met within walking distance​.
