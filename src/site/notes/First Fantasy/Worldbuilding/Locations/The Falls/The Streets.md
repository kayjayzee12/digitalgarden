### Expanded Guide to The Streets of Prismatic Falls

#### **Overview**

The **Streets** form the gritty foundation of Prismatic Falls, serving as the city's dark, damp, and treacherous heart. Known for its pervasive shadows, hazy silhouettes, and harsh lights, this layer is home to the disenfranchised, the desperate, and those living on the edge of society. While officially part of the city, the Streets are often overlooked or outright ignored by the governing cults, creating a chaotic and lawless atmosphere.

#### **Key Features**

    - Accommodations in the Streets are dark, cramped, and often lack windows or proper safety measures.
    - Food is limited to cheap, pre-packaged goods primarily distributed by the Contractor Cult​.
2. **Social Structure**
    
    - Many residents are unaffiliated with cults, choosing to live on the fringes of society. This comes at the cost of personal safety and access to resources.
    - Gangs thrive here, forming unofficial power structures that challenge or supplement cult control​.
3. **Accessibility**
    
    - Few train lines connect to the Streets, and most residents traverse the area on foot. Hovercars are a rarity, with some citizens having never seen one up close​.
