### **6. Mechanics**

The mechanics of _Crystalpunk Chronicles_ serve as the foundation for gameplay, combining core elements from the **ICRPG Master Edition** and the **Crystalpunk Campaign Guide**. This section provides an overview of the primary mechanics that define the game, with room for further expansion and customization in dedicated sections.

#### **[[Core Mechanics\|Core Mechanics]]**

- **Effort-Based Resolution:**  
    Every challenge is resolved using rolls of a d20, modified by a relevant **core stat** (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA). Successful attempts often require follow-up rolls for **Effort**, which measures the time or force needed to overcome a task or enemy.
    
- **Effort Types:**
    
    - **Basic Effort (d4):** Actions requiring no tools, like barehanded fighting or deciphering riddles.
    - **Weapon Effort (d6):** Damage dealt using standard weapons or tools.
    - **Gun Effort (d8):** Specialized for firearms or similar high-impact devices.
    - **Magic Effort (d10):** Used for spells, energy-based effects, or magitech tools.
    - **Ultimate Effort (d12):** Granted on critical successes or through special abilities.
- **The Target:**  
    Each scene has a single **Target Number**, which players must meet or exceed with their rolls. This number simplifies gameplay by unifying difficulty levels across all challenges.
    
- **Hearts as HP:**  
    Health and task difficulty are measured in **Hearts**, where 1 Heart equals 10 HP or 10 points of Effort needed to complete a task. Bosses or legendary tasks may require multiple Hearts.

#### **[[Combat and Action Economy\|Combat and Action Economy]]**

- **Turn Structure:**  
    Play progresses in clockwise turns, emphasizing teamwork and pacing. Players can:
    
    1. Move NEAR and take an action.
    2. Move FAR (double movement).
    3. Stay CLOSE and take an action.
- **Actions and Effort:**  
    On a turn, players can:
    
    - Attack an enemy.
    - Perform a skill check (e.g., hacking, decoding runes).
    - Use a special ability or spell.
    - Interact with the environment (e.g., pull a lever, open a door).
- **Initiative:**  
    Turn order is determined by a d20 roll at the start of combat, with the highest going first. Alternatively, clockwise turns provide consistent pacing.
    
- **Death and Recovery:**
    
    - At 0 HP, players fall unconscious and must roll a **Dying Timer** (d4). If this timer runs out without intervention, the character dies.
    - Allies can stabilize a dying character with a successful INT or WIS check.
    - Players may spend a turn to **Recover**, regaining HP equal to their CON stat + 1 after a successful roll.

#### **[[Timers\|Timers]]**

Timers are used to create tension and urgency in gameplay. Common timer applications include:

- **Countdowns:** Events occur after a set number of ROUNDS or TURNS (e.g., "In 3 turns, the reactor explodes").
- **Environmental Threats:** Lava rising, air running out, or reinforcements arriving.
- **Recharge Timers:** For powerful abilities or weapons that require a cooldown.

#### **[[Movement and Distance\|Movement and Distance]]**

Distances are simplified into four categories:

- **CLOSE:** Within arm’s reach.
- **NEAR:** A few steps away, reachable with movement and an action.
- **FAR:** Requires an entire turn of movement.
- **OUT OF RANGE:** Beyond immediate engagement, requiring special effort or tools to interact.

#### **[[Loot and Crafting\|Loot and Crafting]]**

- **Loot:**  
    Items and gear play a central role in character progression. Players can find, craft, or purchase loot that grants bonuses to stats, abilities, or Effort.
    
- **Crafting:**  
    Using resources and tools, players can build magitech devices, weapons, and potions. Crafting requires INT or WIS rolls and often uses HEARTS to measure progress.

#### **[[Status Effects and Conditions\|Status Effects and Conditions]]**

Status effects create dynamic challenges. Common conditions include:

- **Burning:** Take Magic Effort (d10) each round until extinguished.
- **Poisoned:** Roll HARD on CON checks; failure results in Weapon Effort damage.
- **Stunned:** Lose your next action.
- **Void-Touched:** Suffer random negative effects tied to the Void, such as mutations or uncontrollable powers.

#### **[[Progression and Mastery\|Progression and Mastery]]**

- **Milestones:**  
    Characters progress through milestones, earning new abilities, stat boosts, or access to advanced equipment. Each milestone ties into the job’s specific progression path.
    
- **Mastery:**  
    Rolling natural 20s grants mastery points. Accumulating these points unlocks advanced abilities or upgrades for gear and spells.

#### **[[Advanced Mechanics for Expansion\|Advanced Mechanics for Expansion]]**

This section introduces hooks for further expansion:

- **Faction Influence:** Mechanics for earning favor with or incurring the wrath of powerful factions.
- **Customizable Magitech:** Create personalized devices with unique traits and effects.
- **Environmental Challenges:** Dynamic obstacles like collapsing terrain, rising toxic clouds, or unstable magitech fields.
