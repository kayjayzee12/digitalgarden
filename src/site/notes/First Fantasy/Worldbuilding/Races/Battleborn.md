## **NOTES:**  

### **Origins & History**  
- Battleborn were **created through alchemical mutations** using tiefling cells, magical reagents, and humanoid souls.

### **Culture & Roleplay Ideas**  
- **Struggle for Identity:** Many battleborn are torn between their engineered purpose and personal aspirations. Do they embrace their warrior nature or resist it?  
- **Prejudice & Fear:** Their origins as Imperial weapons lead to **distrust from other societies**. Some battleborn try to prove their worth, while others embrace their intimidating reputation.  
- **Brotherhood & Rivalry:** Even outside the Empire, battleborn often recognize each other as kin—though not all greet each other as friends.
