#NPC 

Drorn Fraxxis is an Ancient Blue Dragon who has been a central figure in the governance of Prismatic Falls as the leader of the Contractor Cult. For over 2700 years, he maintained a position of absolute authority within the cult before transitioning leadership to his daughter, [[First Fantasy/Worldbuilding/Notable NPCs/Tiraer Fraxxis\|Tiraer Fraxxis]], an Adult Blue Dragon, who continues to oversee the faction’s dealings.

  

### Characteristics and Reputation:

• Territorial Authority: Drorn’s immense power and intellect make him a dominating presence. He symbolizes the Contractor Cult’s wealth and influence.

• Symbol of Fear: A particularly notorious display of his dominance includes keeping the preserved soul of the leader of a past revolt trapped in his office. This act is as much a reminder of his ruthlessness as it is a statement about the consequences of dissent.

• Cult Operations: The Fraxxis family is deeply embedded in the financial workings of Prismatic Falls, with strict control over resources and power dynamics. Drorn’s leadership has shaped the cult into an economic powerhouse.

  

### Public Perception:


Drorn is seen as both a visionary leader and a ruthless figure. His careful orchestration of the Contractor Cult’s activities reflects his sharp intellect and cunning nature, solidifying the dragon’s presence as a force to be reckoned with in Aysta .
